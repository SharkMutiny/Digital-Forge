// Built-in String Methods
// Example of .toUpperCase() method

// Example of .toLowerCase() method

// Built-in Number Methods
// Example of .round() method to round to nearest integer

// Example of .floor() method to round down
console.log(Math.floor(5.9)); // 5  
// Example of .ceil() method to round up

// Example of .substring() method to get part of a string (substr is deprecated, use substring instead)
const myName = "Simon Bradley"; 
console.log(myName.substring(0, 5)); // "Simon" (first number is starting index,  second number is ending index, not inclusive)
