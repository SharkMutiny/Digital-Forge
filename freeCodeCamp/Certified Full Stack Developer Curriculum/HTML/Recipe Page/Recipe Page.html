    <h1>Chicken Cacciatore with Risoni</h1>
    <p>
      Chicken Cacciatore – the ultimate one-pot meal and in this recipe I'm
      adding risoni. Juicy chicken, savoury tomatoes, and risoni pasta all come
      together in a symphony of flavours that'll make your taste buds dance.
      Perfect for those nights when you want a hearty meal without a mountain of
      dishes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 chicken thighs, sliced</li>
      <li>2 red capsicums (bell peppers), sliced</li>
      <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, finely diced</li>
      <li>200ml (¾ cup) chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 tin (400g) tomatoes</li>
      <li>300g risoni (orzo)</li>
      <li>200g pitted kalamata olives</li>
      <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>small bunch basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of
        olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the olive oil is at temperature, add the red onion and sliced red
        capsicum with a pinch of salt. Sauté for 2-3 minutes before adding the
        sliced chicken thighs.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the chicken has been cooking for 2-3 minutes, add the garlic and
        stir through before adding the white wine to deglaze the pan. While the
        wine is reducing, add the tomato purée, oregano, and chilli flakes. Stir
        well before adding the tin of tomatoes along with half a tin of water.
        Break the tomatoes up and stir through well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the kalamata olives followed by the risoni and stir well. Once the
        pasta is well incorporated, turn the heat to medium-low and simmer
        gently for 8 minutes, stirring every 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with some basil and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
