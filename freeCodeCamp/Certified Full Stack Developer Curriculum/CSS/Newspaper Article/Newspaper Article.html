      <div class="text">In an unprecedented turn of events, the town of Whiskerville has officially elected a cat named Mr. Whiskers as their new mayor. The unexpected political shakeup came after a write-in campaign, started as a joke, rapidly gained traction among residents tired of “human politics.”</div>
      <div class="text">The four-year-old tabby, known for his stern gaze and impeccable litter-box discipline, won over voters with his straightforward campaign slogan: “Meow Means Meow.” Supporters praised his calm demeanor and insistence on daily treats as a sign of fair leadership.</div>
      <div class="text">City officials are still working out how exactly a cat will govern, but residents remain optimistic. “Honestly, I trust him more than the last guy,” one voter admitted while scratching Mr. Whiskers behind the ears.</div>
