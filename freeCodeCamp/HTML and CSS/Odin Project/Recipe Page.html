    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ready to make the best fudge of your life? You've come to the right place! You'll come back to this creamy fudge recipe again and again.</p>
    <p>This is the best fudge recipe ever! It's my aunt's recipe, passed down through the family. It's easy enough to whip up in 15 minutes or so.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2/3 cup evaporated milk (not condensed milk)</li>
      <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 jar (7 oz) marshmallow creme/fluff</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Pan:  Line an 8x8-inch square baking dish with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Grease lightly with butter.</li>
      <li>Cook the Sugar Mixture:  In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, butter, and evaporated milk.  Stir constantly over medium heat until the mixture comes to a full rolling boil.</li>
      <li>Boil and Stir:  Once boiling, continue stirring constantly for about 4-5 minutes. Use a candy thermometer if possible; the mixture should reach around 234°F (112°C).</li>
      <li>Add Chocolate and Marshmallow Creme:  Remove the saucepan from heat.  Stir in the chocolate chips, marshmallow creme, and vanilla extract. Mix well until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth.</li>
      <li>Optional – Add Nuts:  If you're adding nuts, fold them into the mixture at this stage.</li>
      <li>Transfer and Cool:  Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly.  Let the fudge cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours, or refrigerate to speed up the process.</li>
      <li>Cut and Serve:  Once fully set, remove the fudge from the pan by lifting the foil or parchment paper.  Cut into squares and serve.</li>
    </ol>
