// Character Battle
// Given two strings representing your army and an opposing army, each character from your army battles the character at the same position from the opposing army using the following rules:

// Characters a-z have a strength of 1-26, respectively.
// Characters A-Z have a strength of 27-52, respectively.
// Digits 0-9 have a strength of their face value.
// All other characters have a value of zero.
// Each character can only fight one battle.
// For each battle, the stronger character wins. The army with more victories, wins the war. Return the following values:

// "Opponent retreated" if your army has more characters than the opposing army.
// "We retreated" if the opposing army has more characters than yours.
// "We won" if your army won more battles.
// "We lost" if the opposing army won more battles.
// "It was a tie" if both armies won the same number of battles.
