// Unorder of Operations
// Given an array of integers and an array of string operators, apply the operations to the numbers sequentially from left-to-right. Repeat the operations as needed until all numbers are used. Return the final result.

// For example, given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and ['+', '*'], return the result of evaluating 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 from left-to-right ignoring standard order of operations.

// Valid operators are +, -, *, /, and %.


function evaluate(numbers, operators) {

  return numbers;
