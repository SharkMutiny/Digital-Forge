// IPv4 Validator
// Given a string, determine if it is a valid IPv4 Address. A valid IPv4 address consists of four integer numbers separated by dots (.). Each number must satisfy the following conditions:

// It is between 0 and 255 inclusive.
// It does not have leading zeros (e.g. 0 is allowed, 01 is not).
// Only numeric characters are allowed.
